# portfolio_app

The application is portfolio app, that shows my details; description, about, education, work experience, portfolio etc.
Features: 
- Light/dark mode - the application can switch between light and dark mode.
- Responsiveness - it can fit in any screen size

## Description of the code:
First of all, I used Provider for the state management; as shown in the folder arrangements, the provider folder containers the themeprovider class that extends the ChangeNotifier, this provides us with notifierlistener() that notifier our UI whenever changes(in this case dark/light mode icons) are made on the app.

The view folder contains all the app screens starting from the mainpage, the about to skill page, while the widgets folder containers the custom made widget I made to made the code readable and compact

Finally the assets folder housed all the images I used in the development of the app and also the font

## Library used:
- Provider: I used Provider for the state management because it's easy to use and avoid block codes

- url_laucher: I also used url_launcher for launching my social media handles on external browser bacause of it's ease of usage

## More features:
- I will like to implement the remaining blank screens e.g. resume etc. when I have the time, probably add cool animations to the app.

- I will also like to upgrade the app to a custom portfolio builder, so that people can it to customize their portfolio.

## Challenges: 
The greatest challenge I faced is coming up with a design.
